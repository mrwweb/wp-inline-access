An incredibly incomplete list of things left to do

== Admin ==
* Add support to return to last front-end page that had Edit Mode toggled on.
* Is there any other use for edit mode in the back end? Probably not.
* Styles (and click events?) for targeted elements (added this for widgets, select, and input on 10/09/13)

== Styles ==
* better handling of inline elements (as opposed to block) on front end
* better interface that will be more style agnostic for better theme support
	* thick left border?
	* persistent cog icon?
	* color overlay?

== Edit Support For ==
* Site Title
* posts (i.e. not just the post type "Posts")
	* I don't see how this is possible without theme hooks.
* Term descriptions, basically impossible to filter. boo
* Comments?
* Custom Fields (aka Post Meta)
* the_title, basically impossible to filter. boo

== Other ==
* IMPORTANT: handle permissions when editing an element
* Handle nested editable elements.
	* Excerpt/Featured image in Feature a Page Widget output
	* Menus in "Menus" Widget (and categories and tags widgets probably)
*  more bullet-proofy prevent default handling
