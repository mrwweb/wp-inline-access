== Description ==

([Original Proposal Article](http://mrwweb.com/wp-inline-access/))

**THIS PLUGIN IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. USE AT OWN RISK AND TELL ME HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER (or [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/mrwweb/wp-inline-access)).**

Front end (or "inline") editing sounds great until you try to apply it to large complex CMS sites. Rather than try to keep users out of the admin because they can't understand it, why not build an editing system that teaches them how to use it?

This plugin is designed to work best in conjunction with [MP6](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/) or WP3.8+ and one of the tested themes below.

= Editable Items Supported =
* Menus
* Widgets

= Tested Browsers =
* Chrome

= Themes Tested =
* Twenty Twelve
* Twenty Eleven (Bug: Menu tooltip doesn't appear.)
* Twenty Ten

== Installation ==

= Manual =
1. Download plugin zip file.
1. Unzip into your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
1. Go to Plugins in Dashboard.
1. Activate "WP Inline Access."

= Automatic =
1. In the Dashboard, go to Plugins > Add News.
1. Search for "WP Inline Access."
1. Install plugin.
1. Activate plugin.

= Usage =
Once installed, click the "Toggle Edit Mode" button in the Admin Bar to display the Info Bar and editable page elements.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= So I can click on something and change the text right there? =
No. All editing is still done in the admin. This is NOT front end editing.

= What's your goal for this plugin =

This plugin is a proof of concept for something that, if I dream big, might make it into WordPress Core someday. Until then, you probably shouldn't use this on a production site without understanding the risks of using a plugin in early development stages.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin creates a new "Toggle Edit Mode" button in the Admin Bar. Click it to learn about the web page you're viewing and enable clickable, editable elements.
