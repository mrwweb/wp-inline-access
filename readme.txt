== Description ==

**THIS PLUGIN IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. USE AT OWN RISK AND TELL ME HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER (or [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/mrwweb/wp-inline-access)).**

Front end (or "inline") editing sounds great until you try to apply it to large complex CMS sites. Rather than try to keep users our of the admin because they can't understand it, why not build an editing system that teaches them how to use it? ([Original Article Proposal](http://mrwweb.com/wp-inline-access/))

This plugin is a proof of concept for something that, if I dream big, might make it into WordPress Core someday. Until then, you probably shouldn't use this on a production site without understanding the risks of using a plugin in early development stages.
